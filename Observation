The plot shows that the distribution of the endpoints of the random walks approaches a Gaussian distribution as N increases. 
This is consistent with the central limit theorem, which states that the sum of a large number of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) 
random variables will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the distribution of the individual random variables.







The plot shows the probability distribution of the endpoints of one-dimensional random walks with different number of steps, N. The step lengths are uniformly distributed in (-1/2, 1/2). 
The red line shows the predicted Gaussian distribution for each value of N.
